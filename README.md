# Git Branch Naming Creator
  Is a simple Mac OS application that let you save your time, when you create allowed branch name from task name, for example JIRA task.
This project has born during my commercial project. 
Every day I did the same sings, copy task name in JIRA and format it (removed upper case, insert underline and remove unallowed symbols like "-" etc).
Doing it multiple times a day every day was annoying and trivial, so I decided to create this application that make life of our team little easy.
